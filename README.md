# ENVS-193DS_homework-03

# General Information

This repo is for Homework assignment #3 for the UCSB course ENV S 193DS on statistical applications for environmental studies.

This repo is created by Jessi Rumkin (github username is jrumkin).

The data for the Personal Data project came from data I collected from my own life and is used here as mydata.csv.

The Statistical Critique section is using a paper called "Birds of a feather eat plastic together: High levels of plasric ingestion in great shearwater adults and juveniles across their annual migratory cycle."

A., Bugoni, L., Shield, G., Glass, T., Wiley, D. N., & Lohmann, R. (2022). Birds of a feather eat plastic Together: High levels of plastic ingestion in great shearwater adults and juveniles across their annual migratory cycle. Frontiers in Marine Science, 8. <https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.719721>

This project covers 3 parts: Personal data exploration and visualization, personal data affective visualization, and a statistical critique. 

# Data and file information

## data folder

mydata.csv is a file that contains data for my personal data project. Each row is an observation that includes data like date, start and end time of the study session, duration (decimal hour), sleep (decimal hour), focus score (details below), weather, and company type (alone, friend, or aquaintence).

Focus Score was self determined using this guideline: (1 is the lowest, 5 is the highest, discrete numeric data)

1: Constantly distracted + brain fog, low critical thinking applied

2: Frequently distracted, trouble staying on task, bored, needed to re-do or re-read instructions many times

3: Occasionally distracted, able to return to the task at hand without severe backtracking

4: Mostly focused, some distractions but they are usually intentional breaks

5: Highly focused, very few to no distractions, efficient workflow

## code folder

Homework_3_code.qmd is the code document that was worked on to write code, text, and render the document. 

Homework_3_code_files contains figures preparation files.
