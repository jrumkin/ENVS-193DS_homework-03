# Problem 1: Personal Data

I will be comparing the mean productivity score between two main groups, when I was alone and when I was accompanied for the study sessions in order to determine if working with other people increases my productivity, which is calculated from time spent working and how focused I was. This can help me determine if there is a statistical or significant difference between groups, because I feel like I spend more time on a task in one sitting when I am with other people, so I think my mean productivity will be higher in the accompanied group.
