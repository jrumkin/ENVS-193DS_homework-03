# Problem 1: Personal Data

## a. Data summarizing 

I will be comparing the mean productivity score between two main groups, when I was alone and when I was accompanied for the study sessions in order to determine if working with other people increases my productivity, which is calculated from time spent working and how focused I was. This can help me determine if there is a statistical or significant difference between groups, because I feel like I spend more time on a task in one sitting when I am with other people, so I think my mean productivity will be higher in the accompanied group.

## b. Visualization 


```{r}
#summarizing personal data
mydata_summary <-  mydata |> 
  group_by(accompanied) |> 
  summarise(mean_score = round(mean(final_productivity_score),digits = 1),
            sd = round(sd(final_productivity_score), digits = 1),
            se = round((sd(final_productivity_score)/sqrt(length(final_productivity_score))),digits = 1),
            ci_lower = round(mean_score - 1.96 * (sd(final_productivity_score)/ sqrt(length(final_productivity_score))),digits = 1),
            ci_upper = round(mean_score + 1.96 * (sd(final_productivity_score) / sqrt(length(final_productivity_score))),digits = 1)
  )
